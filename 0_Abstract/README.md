## M2_Simple-Traffic-Light-System-with-Pedestrian-Crossing

# Introduction
The use of personal vehicles is very common now a days and a result, the number of vehicles on the roads are exponentially increasing. Roads without any supervision or guidance can lead in to traffic congestions and accidents.

Traffic Lights or Traffic Signals are signalling devices that are used to control the flow of traffic. Generally, they are positioned at junctions, intersections, ‘X’ roads, pedestrian crossings etc. and alternate the priority of who has to wait and who has to go
This is a simple project that helps to controll the traffic signals and allow the common people cross the road in ease.
# Features
Simple, low-cost, and real time traffic signal system that aims to overcome many problems and improves the traffic system and the system is based on ATMEGA 328.
